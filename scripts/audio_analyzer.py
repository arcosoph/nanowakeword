audio_analyzer.py

This is an advanced audio quality checking tool.
It not only checks for sample rate and mono channel,
but also verifies:

‚úÖ Minimum & maximum duration
‚úÖ Acceptable volume (RMS) level
‚úÖ Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to detect noisy files

This helps you ensure your dataset is clean and balanced 
before training a wake-word detection model.
